# Chick-fil A mockup

Chick-fil-A website was a full-stack application with Manager, Server, Customer, and Menu views. It featured a POS system, inventory
management, and customer ordering capabilities. The backend and front end were built using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and React.
Furthermore, I integrated APIs like Weather, Google Translate, and Google OAuth. The project adhered to WCAG 2.1 accessibility
guidelines. I worked as a full-stack developer and project manager of a team of four, conducting SCRUM meetings, following Agile
methodology, updating project and sprint backlog, and creating burndown charts.

Description: This video provides a walkthrough of various functionalities, including the homepage, menu page, Google Translate integration, weather feature, and Google OAuth API implementation. 
Users can navigate from the homepage to access the menu and place orders. Additionally, the system ensures secure access for servers or managers to their designated pages by authenticating credentials through the Google OAuth API.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
